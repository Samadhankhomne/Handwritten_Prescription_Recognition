# Handwritten_Prescription_Recognition
Deep Learning-based solution for recognizing handwritten prescriptions from the Doctors Handwritten Prescription BD dataset.
This project aims to achieve over 66% accuracy in classifying prescription images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with data augmentation. The repository includes a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training, while maintaining data integrity by preventing data leaks. Built and trained on Kaggle Notebooks with a focus on reproducibility and scalability.
